        <p1 class="about">This site is a progressive web app that allows the user to browse a art shop's inventory without needing any internet connectivity. Once visted, the user should be able to access and interact with the site both online and offline. There is a notification saying when a user's order had been sent. Ideally in a live site, you would only see this once it connected to a database but this site does not have a database so it will always say your order went through. On a real progressive web app, this notification should only pop up once an order is actually placed.</p1>
